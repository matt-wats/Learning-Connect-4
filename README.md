# Learning-Connect-4

Uses an Agent (Convolutional Neural Network) to evaluate Connect 4 Positions, to guide a Monte-Carlo Tree Search in playing Connect 4.
It plays a game against itself, then trains the Agent's parameters to better predict the game's final scoring.

Loosely based off of, and very much simplified off, AlphaZero.
